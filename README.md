## Leaflet_Challenge
#### USGS Earthquake Size & Depth Data

## Description
In this challenge, I was assigned the task of devising a visualization solution for USGS data that will enhance public awareness and inform other government organizations. The ultimate goal is to facilitate better understanding of the issues affecting our planet, with the additional hope of attracting increased funding support.

The United States Geological Survey, abbreviated as USGS, plays a crucial role in furnishing scientific data concerning natural hazards, ecosystem health, environmental conditions, and the repercussions of climate and land-use changes. Their scientists continually innovate methods and tools to offer timely, pertinent, and valuable information about Earth and its processes.
The USGS is currently interested in creating a novel set of tools designed to visually represent their earthquake data. Despite accumulating vast amounts of data worldwide daily, they lack a meaningful method for presenting it. To accomplish this analysis, I utilized my Mac OS, Visual Studio Code, Leaflet, Javascript, HTML, and GitHub.

## Table of Contents
Code for analysis is found in the ‘logic.js’ & ‘index.html’ files within the ‘Leaflet_Part_1/Starter_Code’ directory on my github 'leaflet_challenge' repo. Data for analysis was compiled into the 'logic.js' located in the ‘Leaflet_Part_1/Starter_Code’ directory. The dataset used for this analysis came from the USGS GeoJSON feed located here: https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php.

## Installation Instructions
Code utilized for this challenge can be found in the files within the main directory on my github 'leaflet_challenge' repo.

## Usage
Can Git Clone all files from my 'leaflet_challenge' repo.

## Credits
For this challenge I utilized the ASK BCS feature on Slack, Google, ChatGPT, fellow students, YouTube, Stack Overflow, TA assistance, Bootcamp tutor assistance, and educational resources related to the unit provided by the bootcamp.
